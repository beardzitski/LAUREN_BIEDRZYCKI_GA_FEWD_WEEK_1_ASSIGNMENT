SOME NOTES ON THIS PROJECT

General Thoughts:
I found this project really fun, I got pretty excited and wanted to do a lot of things but my beginner knowledge definitely held me back. I'm sure I'll be able to add more to is as I grow.

Things I'd like to learn:
- How to put the portfolio items in a thumbnail with blurb kind of box, all in the 3 or 4 column layout.
- Push the footer to the bottom and make a sticky footer
- How to put a transparent image overlay over a background image.

Problems I can see but haven't worked out:
- Curves are uneven on profile image. Even though the image file i square, it resizes in the browser unevenly.
- Colours, typography and general design aren't what I'd like, but I can develop this at a later date.
-There's something really wrong with my portfolio page code - I ended up doing what I'm sure is unconventional/inefficient/ugly/bad code and just put some <br />'s in so that I could get the images to stop stacking strangely over the top of each other - I think it must have something to do with the float?

Other:
- Need to step up professional social media game.

I would love any and all feedback! Keen to learn how to write some super tight code!
